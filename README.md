This simple utility is designed to stitch 2 subtitle tracks for a video.

Can be useful for learning languages while watching movies.
Just select the path to the main and secondary subtitle tracks, adjust the color and position of the text, and if necessary, adjust the path and file name for the result track.
Then click "Process". This is all.
Enjoy!
